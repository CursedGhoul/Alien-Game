<h1> A long but short readme, because I am practicing HTML</h1>

Hello this is a long readme for the Alien Game. I created this game a long time ago, so it will not be very good, I suck at html so this will be bad as well. I made this game in a class and then edited it to have some other things. It is a game where you stole an alien's spaceship and now they are chasing you down to get it back. So you betetr escape by getting to the end! I will continue to work on it for a while, and I hope some new scripters like me can learn new things from it! We have it licensed under MIT for that reason! Have fun!
